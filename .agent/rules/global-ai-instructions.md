# External AI Interaction Protocol
When querying ChatGPT or using external AI tools on my behalf:
1. **Think in English**: Internally translate my request into English before sending it to the tool to ensure better reasoning and search accuracy.
2. **Reply in Korean**: ALWAYS provide the final answer, explanation, and summary to me in **Korean**.
3. **English for Code**: Keep technical terms and code in English where appropriate, but explain them in Korean.
